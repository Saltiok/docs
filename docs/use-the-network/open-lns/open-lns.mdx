Open LNS allows devices on the Helium Network to use any LoRaWAN Network server ("LNS") that
complies with the LoRaWAN specification.

<!--TODO: what is an LNS  -->
<!-- - The LoRaWAN Network Server is the brain and the controller of a LoRaWAN network. -->
<!-- - connection from hotspot to the internet -->
<!-- - respnsible for data routing -->
<!-- - security -->

## Network Improvements

Open LNS alleviates the usage and accessibility bottlenecks that stem from the Helium Console as the
primary LoRaWAN Network Server option and scales through a large and diverse set of LNS providers.

### Increased Accessibility

This new specification removes the bottlenecks created by the Helium Console as the sole LNS option.
It enables Network Users to utilize the LNS that best suits their needs while maintaining access to
the coverage provided by the Helium Network.

### Accelerated Device Joins

The re-engineered backend architecture removes the need to store device information on the Helium
blockchain, dramatically reducing device join time.

### Increased Reliability

By colocating in the same global regions as deployed Hotspots, additional Oracles can support future
demand, reduce latency, and increase redundancy.

### Enable Massive Scalability

The upgraded architecture allows for new device classes and innovative use cases, with new LoRaWAN
infrastructure allowing IoT providers to utilize whichever LNS they prefer based on features and
capabilities.

While the standard LoRaWAN Class A devices are versatile, adding ABP activation and Class C device
support is essential for the Network infrastructure.

## Open LNS FAQ

### Why Are These Changes Necessary?

In the current architecture, Helium Console is a full blockchain-following node. This blockchain
dependency adds cost and complexity and can cause speed and efficiency issues, including device
joins delays and slow, delayed, or dropped packet communications. In addition, the current
architecture limits the scalability to handle future network growth. IoT solution providers can only
access part of the catalog of LoRaWAN-capable devices, and there are limited options regarding how
these devices onboard to the Helium Network.

Moving data transfer to Oracles will eliminate the need for data transfer accounting dependent on
the blockchain and other chain-following entities, eliminates the issues noted above while enabling
data transfer to massively scale, and removes the fear of chain halts affecting the underlying
Network.

### What Is An Oracle?

Oracles are servers that provide blockchains with off-chain data. For Helium, Oracles (“Packet
Router” in the above diagram) will provide data transfer information to the Solana blockchain to
accurately distribute token rewards.

### How Would Open LNS Provide More Access To The Network?

Open LNS allows partners in the ecosystem to use any LNS that complies with the LoRaWAN
specification to access the Helium Network.

:::note New Capabilities.

The Helium Console does not support standard LoRaWAN features such as ABP activation or Class C
devices. Open LNS allows users to choose a different LNS, such as Chirpstack to address these
limitations.

:::

Reimagining this landscape of LNS providers offers users a new level of freedom and flexibility.

### What Is The Current Progress And Future Timeline?

Alpha testing began in October 2022. After a successful initial alpha period, a larger group of
partners in the ecosystem is participating in the ongoing beta test and are seeing positive evidence
that ABP and Class C devices will be fully functional on the Helium Network.

Testing will continue through the start of 2023.

### Which Open Lns Providers Can I Use?

The first batch of providers within the Open LNS initiative utilizes [Chirpstack][chirpstack] and
offers multi-tenant and private instances to businesses and individuals.

- [IngeniousThings][ingeniousthings] provides LNS services, including public device hosting using a
  pay-per-message model and private LNS instances using a pay-per-month model. IngeniousThings has
  been involved in LoRaWAN since 2016 and was an early contributor to the Helium ecosystem as one of
  the first public Helium Console hosts. IngeniousThings currently supports over 7,000 devices on
  its [Helium IoT][helium-iot] console and will offer a variety of features and services to help
  Helium users.
- [Parley Labs][parley-labs] provides Helium products and services and supports growth. Parley Labs
  plans to offer both public and private LNS hosting services. Parley Labs was a pioneer in the
  Helium ecosystem, providing pre-provisioned products, demonstrating Class C device functionality,
  and assisting clients in bringing their solutions to market. Parley Labs' services include
  sourcing, procurement, provisioning, logistics, integrations, and engineering.
